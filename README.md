# gerbil-treadmill

This is the back-end for [Treadmill](https://github.com/thunknyc/emacs-treadmill), an environment for interacting with Gerbil in Emacs.

Typically, you will install this package via `gxpkg install github.com/thunknyc/gerbil-treadmill` and then connect to Gerbil via `M-x treadmill-spawn` from within Emacs. However, if you want to run your own [Gerbil network REPL](https://cons.io/reference/net.html#network-repl), you can connect to it via `M-x treadmill-connect`.
